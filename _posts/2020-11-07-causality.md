# An introduction to causality

This is the first chapter of a series of two, aiming to discuss tools to leverage invariances in a dataset to build robust predictors. 

In this first chapter we introduce the language of causality, linking the universe of `cause and effect' to probability theory. We define the probabilistic role of causal parents and formalise the concepts of causal invariance and interventional environments.
